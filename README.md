# To-Do List (JavaScript)

A simple to-do list application built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The application allows you to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Tasks are saved to `localStorage` so they persist even after the page is refreshed.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Add new tasks to the list.
- **Delete Task**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Mark as Completed**: Mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved to `localStorage`.
